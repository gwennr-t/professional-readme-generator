# Professional README Generator Starter Code
This is a README.md Generator. The user is prompted for information in the command-line about their application repository. The user inputs responses into the command line. These responses generate a README.md with the project title, and the following sections: Description, Table of Conntents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

# Credits
This generator was made using JavaScript, Node.js, and Inquirer. Resources from class, Stack Overflow, and W3Schools were utilized to support creation as well.
